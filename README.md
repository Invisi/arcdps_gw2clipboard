## ArcDPS GW2Clipboard plug-in

An ArcDPS plug-in to integrate [GW2Clipboard](https://github.com/maklorgw2/gw2clipboard) with [ArcDPS](https://www.deltaconnected.com/arcdps/).

**GW2Clipboard version 1.1.0 or above is required**

This simple plugin opens gw2clipboard, or if already opened restores the window if applicable when Guild Wars 2 is opened.

When Guild Wars 2 is closed, this plugin notifies gw2clipboard to minimize to the system tray or close the application depending on settings.

It is not anticipated that this dll will need to be updated often after installation (if at all).

### Installation

Download the current dll from the [Releases](https://github.com/maklorgw2/arcdps_gw2clipboard/releases) page and copy this file into the **bin64** directory under your Guild Wars 2 folder (For example: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2\bin64*)

A configuration file is required to tell this plug-in where gw2clipboard has been installed. 
* The required folder and ini file will be automatically created the first time the plugin is loaded with ArcDPS inside the **addons/gw2clipboard** folder.
* If you need to create this manually:
  - Create a folder named **gw2clipboard** inside the **addons** folder (For example: *C:\Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2\addons\gw2clipboard*)
  - Create a file named **gw2clipboard.ini**

The configuration file needs to contain the following lines
```sh
PATH=C:\Program Files (x86)\Guild Wars 2\addons\gw2clipboard
CLOSE=1
```

* *Please use the path where you have installed GW2Clipboard if this default path is incorrect*
* *If CLOSE is 1, GW2Clipboard will close when Guild Wars 2 closes, if it is set to 0, GW2Clipboard will minimize to the system tray when Guild Wars 2 closes*

The next time you run Guild Wars 2, if configured correctly GW2Clipboard should be automatically run.

### Compilation notes
